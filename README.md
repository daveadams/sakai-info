sakai-info
==========

*sakai-info* is a command line tool and a suite of Ruby libraries which enable the exploration of a Sakai database without the intermediation of a Java VM or any official Sakai code. Because the primary goal of this tool is to assist in information gathering and troubleshooting, no capability to change the database is included in the tool or the libraries.

Caveat
------

I'm starting from an installation-specific set of libraries and scripts, and hoping to make them more generic. The initial updates will probably be incomplete.
